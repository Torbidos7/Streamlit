# Streamlit
This repository is a trial space for exploring and understanding the functionalities of `Streamlit`, a Python library that allows you to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

## About the Code

The main script, `streamlit_app.py`, demonstrates the use of `Streamlit` to create a simple data visualization interface. It includes a slider and `Streamlit` widgets to create a user interface to plot some spirals. Moreover it prints out some stats about the machine in which the program is running.

## Online Demo

You can find a demo of the web app hosted on Streamlit Cloud: 
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://system-in.streamlit.app/)

## Running the Code

To run the code, navigate to the directory containing `streamlit_app.py` and execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
This will start the Streamlit web application.
